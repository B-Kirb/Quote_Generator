# Quote Generator

A simple, clean web app that serves up random quotes. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Great starter project or fun widget add-on.

## What’s Inside

**index.html** - the front end layout

**style.css** - basic styles to make things look good

**quotes.js** - your list of quotes

**script.js** - the logic that picks and displays a random quote

**favicon.png** - little icon for the browser tab

Repo shows the breakdown and languages used: mostly JavaScript (~90 %), with CSS and HTML rounding it out

.

## How to Run

Clone it:

git clone https://github.com/B-Kirb/Quote_Generator.git


Open index.html in any browser.

Click the button (or whatever trigger you have) to get a fresh quote.

## Why It’s Cool

Hands-on with DOM manipulation

Modular—quotes are separate from logic

Lightweight, easy to remix or expand

## Suggestions to Level It Up

Fetch quotes from a remote API instead of a locally stored list

Add animations or styles for quote transitions

Let users add or favorite quotes

Add categories or filters (motivational, funny, etc.)
